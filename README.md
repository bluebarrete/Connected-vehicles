# Azure Data migration - Connected Vehicles
This project involves creation of a **Cloud-to-Cloud Data Migration** solution based on a Data engineering- Business use case. The architecture has been deployed on **Azure cloud**.

"The end goal was to make a pipeline to pull **real time** data from AWS s3 buckets and store it in a Azure Datalake- gen2 and run validation testing to sort through invalid file formatting and push it to a Azure SQL database and to be able to do it dynamically"

### Business Case: 

*"Ford is a one of the leading Heavy Vehicle manufacturing companies. To improve their services, they are planning to rollout new features in the coming models. These features are based on IOT solutions, that detect hazardous and pre-malfunction conditions to alert the driver in advance."*

For this to work Ford ties up with a third party that provides them with a **IOT** device that can be plugged into the car, the **sensors gather real-time data on fuel consumption, engine temperature, fluid levels, run time etc**
